# libpower-grid-model-java

## Usage

The PGM methods are available through class `org.lfenergy.pgm.PowerGridModelC`. The method names are identical to the method names in the C-documentation.

To load the native library there are two options:
- on supported architectures, the library can be autoloaded using `PGMLoader.autoload()`
- on other architecture, you can build and load the library yourself using `System.load(...)`, and verify if you've loaded it correctly using `PGMLoader.verifyLoaded()`.

## Supported architectures

- Mac OS ARM64 (Apple with M1 chip and newer)
- Mac OS x86-64 (Apple with Intel chips)
- Linux ARM64 (e.g. Snapdragon CPU)
- Linux x86-64 (Intel, AMD, etc.)
- Windows x86-64 (Intel, AMD, etc.)
